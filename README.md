## 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm a Computer Science professional with a deep focus on AI, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing — currently pursuing a research-based Master’s at Ontario Tech University, where my work centers on improving the fairness, trust, and efficiency of LLMs and multilingual NLP systems.

🚀 I’ve led and published impactful research (NAACL, ICST) in areas like:

- Multilingual model alignment and performance benchmarking (ALIGNFREEZE)
- Flaky test detection using few-shot learning and Siamese networks (FlakyXbert)
- Data leakage mitigation in LLM benchmarks (HumanEval analysis)

My mission? To build scalable, trustworthy AI solutions — especially for resource-constrained environments — that bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world applications.

🧠 Key Strengths:
• LLMOps & MLOps expertise
• Proficient in PyTorch, Hugging Face, BERT, Transformers
• Strong in NLP, few-shot learning, and evaluation frameworks
• End-to-end experience from research to deployment
• Cross-functional collaboration, teaching & mentoring (500+ students taught)

🌎 Previously, I’ve worked with Google-Talentsprint, Major League Hacking, and open-source communities, contributing to both academic and applied AI problems.

✅ Currently open to:

- ML/NLP/LLM Engineer roles
- AI Research positions (industry or labs)
- Internships or part-time roles in MLOps/LLMOps

Let’s connect if you're looking for someone who brings deep technical expertise, a researcher's curiosity, and a builder's mindset.
