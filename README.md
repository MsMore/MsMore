## 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm a graduate researcher at Ontario Tech University with a passion for **AI, machine learning**, and **natural language processing**. My journey includes roles at **Google, MITACS**, and academic labs, focusing on **LLMs, fairness in AI, low-resource optimization**, and **game-based learning**.

🔍 **Research Interests**:
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- NLP for Software Engineering
- AI Fairness and Trustworthiness
- Low-resource ML & Optimization

🏅 **Highlights**:
- Published at **NAACL** and **IEEE ICST 2025**
- Selected as a **Google Women Techmakers Fellow**
- Designed **FlakyXbert**, an optimized model for flaky test detection
- Built **Threaded Paws**, an educational game on parallel programming

## 🚀 Featured Project: **FlakyXbert**

> *A lightweight, few-shot learning model for flaky test detection*

🔬 **What it does**:  
Uses fine-tuned LLMs and Siamese networks to identify flaky software tests with minimal data.

📌 **Key Features**:
- +20% accuracy over baselines
- 80% reduced compute cost
- Built with PyTorch and HuggingFace Transformers
- Published at IEEE ICST 2025

📄 **Publication**:  
[_An Analysis of LLM Fine-Tuning and Few-Shot Learning for Flaky Test Detection_](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=-T-0keIAAAAJ)
